## AI-Generated Code Policy

Pull requests that are primarily generated by AI tools (e.g., "vibe coding" or autonomous AI agents) will not be accepted.

Contributions should be:

- Thoughtfully written by humans
- Well-understood by the contributor
- Properly tested and validated

Using AI tools to assist with code completion, suggestions, or documentation is fine, but the contributor must understand and take responsibility for all submitted code.

Use Discussions for open-ended ideas or proposals.

## License

All contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.
